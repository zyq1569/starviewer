/**
This class will show studies and series in an organized and easy way.
This class is a modification of the QTreeWidget that has been adapted to display
 study / series / image search information.
The class maintains the list of Studies / Series / Image that are inserted,
and are removed by invoking the clean method of the class, so remember
that classes that invoke methods that return pointers to Study / Series / Image
will be responsible for making a copy if they need to
keep the object alive once cleaned.

This class has two behaviors based on setUseDICOMSourceToDiscriminateStudies,
which allows us to establish whether studies should be discriminated apart from with the UID
by DICOMSource as well. Depending on what is established, studies with
the same UID but different DICOMSource will be considered as the same study (duplicates) or will be considered
as different studies.
