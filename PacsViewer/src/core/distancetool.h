/**
    Tool for measuring distances in a 2D viewfinder.
    It allows us to fix two points on the screen and calculate the distance between them.

    To mark each of the points will be done with a click or double-click with the left button
    of the mouse.
    Once the first point of the distance to be calculated is marked, a line will be displayed that will join
    the first point marked with the point where the mouse pointer is. While the user does not
    marked the second point, no distance information will be displayed at that time.

    Once the second point is marked, the measurement will be displayed in millimeters, if information exists
    of spacing, in pixels otherwise.

    Once the measurement is completed, as many measurements as desired can be recorded successively.

    The annotated measurements will only appear on the images on which they were taken,
    but they are not erased if we change image. If we change the image but show it again later
    the annotations made on this previously, will reappear.

    When the viewfinder input is changed, the entries made up to that point will be deleted.
    When the tool is deactivated, the annotations made up to that point will be maintained.
