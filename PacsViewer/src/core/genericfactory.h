/**
Class that serves as the basis for implementing the Factory pattern.
The use of this class is internal to the platform and should not be used unless it is being developed by the core.
Its utility, along with GenericFactoryRegister, is to provide a generic implementation of the Factory pattern.

This class is useful when generating classes in the same class hierarchy. For example, if we had
the Vehicle class as an abstract class and the Truck, Car, Motorcycle classes as inheriting classes from Vehicle,
we could use the GenericFactory to instantiate objects such as Truck, Car or Motorcycle but that were returned
as Vehicles.

The current implementation assumes that all objects to be created will inherit from QObject and therefore its constructor.
has a parameter that is the relative of this one.

Usage example:
@code
// We create a Vehicle Factory that will be identified by a string. Vehicles and their children are subclasses of QObject
typedef GenericFactory <Vehicle, std :: string> VehicleFactory;

VehicleFactory vehicles;

// .. Here we should register the different classes with the Factory.
// See GenericFactoryRegister for a simple way

Vehicle * vehicle = vehicles-> create ("car");
Vehicle * vehicle2 = vehicles-> create ("motorcycle");

std :: cout << "Total wheels =" << vehicle-> getNumeroRodes () + vehicle2-> getNumeroRodes () << std :: endl;

// .. This would print "Total Wheels = 6" assuming car returns 4 and motorcycle 2.
@endcode
Although this is not done in the example, it would be necessary to look at whether the returned object is NULL or not.

This class will be used, most of the time, with a singleton to facilitate registration and access but it does not have to.

@TODO If this class is used in conjunction with a singleton, only one object of each type can be used.
@TODO If necessary, the most generic implementation should be made to allow 0 to n parameters in the constructor and not
do not force created objects to inherit from QObject.
