/**
This class is in charge of telling us which rotation and flip operations we need to apply
on a 2D image given the initial orientation and the desired orientation.

To do this we will indicate the initial and desired orientation through the setInitialOrientation () methods
and setDesiredOrientation (). Once the guidelines have been assigned, we will ask for the necessary operations
apply on the 2D image to get the desired orientation.

The order in which the indicated operations are applied * is unique * and must be strictly as follows:
1. Apply rotations
2. Apply flips

This class only contemplates possible operations within the same 2D plan, so it cannot give us
a formula that passes an acquired image in axial to sagittal, e.g.
In these cases, getNumberOfClockwiseTurnsToApply () and requiresHorizontalFlip () will return 0 and false respectively.
