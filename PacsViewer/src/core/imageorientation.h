This class encapsulates the DICOM Image Orientation (Patient) attribute (0020,0037) which defines the directions of the vectors in the first row and column
of the image with respect to the patient. For more information see PS 3.3, section C.7.6.2.1.1.

In DICOM format this attribute consists of 6 values separated by '\', the first 3 being the vector of the row and the last 3 the vector of the column.

This class also keeps the normal of the plane formed by these two vectors.
