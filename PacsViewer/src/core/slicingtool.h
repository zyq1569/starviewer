/**
Base class for slicing tools composed of axes which can be assigned an scrolling mode.

Use this class as a base class to implement your slicing tools. It will abstract your specific implementation to deal with the viewer.

The axis concept is like an slider UI control:
 - Has a current position.
 - Position can be changed within an specified range.
 - The range has a minimum and maximum value.

An SlicingTool can have as many axes as you want. Use setNumberOfAxes(unsigned int numberOfAxes) to set them.

Each axis can be assigned a mode (\link SlicingTool::SlicingMode \endlink). A mode is something that can be scrolled like:
    - \link SlicingMode::None \endlink \n
      Does nothing (default value).
    - \link SlicingMode::Slice \endlink \n
      Slices of the current viewer.
    - \link SlicingMode::Phase \endlink \n
      Phases of the current viewer.
    - \link SlicingMode::Volume \endlink \n
      Volumes of the current study.

When implementing your own slicing tool, you should model its behaviour with axes using those methods:
    - getMinimum(unsigned int axis) const
    - getMaximum(unsigned int axis) const
    - getRangeSize(unsigned int axis) const
    - getLocation(unsigned int axis) const
    - setLocation(unsigned int axis, double location)
    - incrementLocation(unsigned int axis, double shift)

However if you need to direct interaction without dealing with axes, you may use those other methods:
    - getMinimum(SlicingMode mode) const
    - getMaximum(SlicingMode mode) const
    - getRangeSize(SlicingMode mode) const
    - getLocation(SlicingMode mode) const
    - setLocation(SlicingMode mode, double location)
    - incrementLocation(SlicingMode mode, double shift)

When a volume is loaded or there's another major change to the viewer like a change on thick slab, etc... you can react to it by implementing the reassignAxes
function. Then you can decide which function assign on each axis depending on the context (for example, in a series that has only phases you might want to 
scroll phases on booth axes).

Axes mode assignations are stored in a vector where the axis number is the vector index. The number of axes and its modes can be changed on the fly with:
    - setNumberOfAxes(unsigned int numberOfAxes)
    - setMode(unsigned int axis, SlicingMode mode)

Albeit volumes and phases will always be an integer, your implementation should be prepared to handle decimal positions. For this reason incrementLocation() 
returns a decimal number which is the amount of unused increment. For example, when setting to the phase 0.6 will mean rounding to 1 and thus having an excess 
of -0.4. Your implementation may use this information to know when a limit has been reached.

Note that when rounding occurs, the unused amounts will be in the -0.5 to +0.5 interval, however when a limit is reached, that interval will be escaped.
