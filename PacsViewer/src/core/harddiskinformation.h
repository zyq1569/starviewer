Class that allows us to get information about a hard drive. More specifically it allows us to get the Bytes, MB, GB of a partition and which of these are free.
Keep in mind that when you want to know the free space of a hard drive you must specify from which partition. In windows the
drive (c :, d :, ...) and a directory and in linux you must specify the full path of the directory to know the partition. Currently this class only supports
Unix-based operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X ...).
